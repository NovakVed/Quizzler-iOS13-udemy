## Our Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to take you one step further in your journey of becoming an app developer. We are going to introduce you to the holy grail of mobile design patterns: the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. A design pattern is simply a repeatable and optimised solution to a common software problem. We’ll learn more about this when you see it used in the tutorial.

## What you will create

You will program a trivia quiz app, inspired by the awesome “Quiz Up” game. If you have another field of expertise, you’ll be glad to know that multiple choice question apps are one of the most popular types of educational apps on the App Store! 

## What you will learn

* What is a design pattern and how is it used in programming.
* How to use the Model-View-Controller or MVC pattern for app development.
* Learn about Object Oriented Programming.
* How to store data locally.
* How to incorporate third party libraries and how to display Heads Up Displays (HUDs).
* How to refactor code and stay organised.
* Learn about class initialisation. 
* How to programmatically change UI elements such as Labels and Views.
* Start thinking about data encapsulation and how to keep your data safe from corruption.
